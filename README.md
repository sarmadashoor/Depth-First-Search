# Depth-First-Search
An implementation of Depth First Search Algorithm 

This program implements the depth first search algorithm through the completion of a 3x3x3 cube which is broken in to 7 pieces. 

The text file "cubes.txt" contains the parameters of the cube and each individual piece. The cube is broken in to 7 pieces and each individual piece is then mapped using an xyz coordinate system. 

When the parameters of the cube are read by the program, it outputs the order in which the pieces are to be placed in, in order to correctly make the 3x3x3 cube. The depth first search algorithm is used in order to accurately and quickly put the pieces in their correct order.
